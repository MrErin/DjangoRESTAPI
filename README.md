# Django REST API Tutorial

Familiarizing myself with Django API through this tutorial: [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#tutorial)

## To Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. From the command line, cd into the root directory (wherever the manage.py file is located).
3. Type ```python manage.py runserver``` into the command line.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## Notes about virtual env

1. cd into myvenv directory
2. run the following:

```shell
. Scripts/activate
```

You will know the virtual environment is running when the command prompt is preceded with "(myvenv)" (or whatever you named your virtual environment)
